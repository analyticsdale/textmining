The unique item about this corpus is that it comes from a well read and well regarded literary work. It is well known and has been critiqued throughout the years. Using this book for text mining and sentiment analysis is a good choice because there is already a significant amount of research behind the novel. Doing sentiment analysis on this book will provide another avenue of research and we will be able to assess our analysis against the established literary criticism and reviews.\n",

I needed to remove that from the corpus (I replaced it with an empty string) because the url provided no value to me. Due to it being a PDF there were many new line characters. I added an entry in the dictionary to remove the new line symbol with an empty character as well. \n",

Following the reasoning in class, I replaced \"boat\" with \"boats\" and \"fishes\" with \"fish\". These tokens can be grouped together because they provide the same information for our needs. Grouping them together will allow us to reduce the feature space while still maintaining the right amount of information. \n",

    "What is the effect of the replacement on your feature space?  Does this make sense? Is it helpful for answering your question?  Why or why not?\n",
    "As anticipated, the feature space is reduced by about 80 tokens. This is expected because we removed some tokens completely and for others we grouped them together. This helps us because it is more manageable and we have not lost any important information. For other types of replacements I would try to group character names and nicknames togeter. For example, if the main character is address by his first name, full name, and Mr. Lastname then I would create a dictionary entry to map those tokens to a single token."

Each page of the book is compared against the sentiment dictionary and a tally is kept. In general, if there are more postives point for the page then the page is labeled positive, if it is zero then it is neutral, and if it is negative then the page is labeled negative.

    "I think it is pretty easy to arrive at a predetermined conclusion and there are several examples to support this. One immediate example is confirmation bias. We typically find information that supports our preconceived ideas of the world or model. If we find information that refutes our understanding we are more inclined to critique it and find flaws in the logic. This concern of predetermined conclusions isn't just unique to data science but exists in all sorts of fields. The joke about accountants \"well, what do you want the numbers to equal\" comes to mind. \n",

    "In terms of data science specifically, we see this issue frequently, as pointed out in the book \"Weapons of Math Destruction\". We build a model based on some assumptions and the model turns into a positive feedback loop. A scenario I've been working through recently consists of policing. Let's say we decide to put more police officers in a lower income area because we believe that typically those areas have a higher crimes. If there are more officers in that area then it would most likely end up correlating to a higher amount of arrests. The higher arrests then \"prove\" that lower income areas have more crime so we then allocate more officers to that area and the cycle continues. Depending on what the model is to be used for, the ethical implications can range wildly.\n",

    "Your role as a data scientist, as a scientist in general, is to try to remain as objective as possible and let the data speak for itself. When new models or theories come out it is important to evaluate them for what they are and not get caught up in new trends for the sake of it being something new. Likewise, it is important to remain a constant learner so you do not get stuck in outdated modes of thinking. "
