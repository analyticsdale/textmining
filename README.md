Class Project

Q4
Team members: Cory Lowe, Nathan Shores, and Dylan Dale
Project Outline:
We would like to be able to predict a well known author based on the text from their book. The authors that are included currently for our prediction are: Hemingway, Tolstoy, and Faulkner. We are using their well known novels to assist us with our predictions. Our corpus will consist of pages from their novels.
How could this be used? Library science, predict unknown authors, predict plagiarism
